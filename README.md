# PeakDecon
Peak Deconvolution MATLAB GUI  
This GUI software was developed to deconvolute size exclusion chromatograms. Regardless of the developer's intention, PeakDecon can be applied to the general applications of NMF or the deconvolution of other types of peaks.
# Prerequisites
- MATLAB (tested for R2019a and R2019b).
- Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm: Download it [here ](https://github.com/kimjingu/nonnegfac-matlab)
# Packages
- guiPre: Data pre-processing GUI
- guiPD: Peak deconvolution GUI
- guiPost: Data post-processing GUI
# Installation and Tutorial
Please see the PDF manual.
